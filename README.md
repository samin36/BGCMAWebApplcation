**Install Guide**

**PRE-REQUISITES**

- You must have Node.js and Yarn installed.
  - Node.js can be installed from: [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - Node.js comes with a package manager called npm which can be used to install Yarn: [https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)

**DEPENDENCIES**

- The files downloaded from the Github repository include a script to install any necessary dependencies. There is no need to install any third-party software manually besides Node.js and Yarn.

**DOWNLOAD**

- [https://github.com/samin36/BGCMAWebApplication](https://github.com/samin36/BGCMAWebApplication)

**BUILD**

- To build the necessary components of the application:
  - Navigate to the folder containing the downloaded files
  - If you are in the right folder, you should see a file called &quot;package.json&quot;
  - Open the terminal (CMD/Git Bash on Windows), type in &quot;yarn install&quot;, and press Enter
  - If done correctly, yarn will install all the dependencies and build the application

**INSTALLATION**

- Yarn installs the necessary dependencies for Firebase (database) to work, but it is still required for the user to link the application to their Firebase Project.
  - Go to [https://console.firebase.google.com/](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and login using a Google account, if not already.
  - Click on the + icon as shown below
 ![](RackMultipart20201122-4-136nf96_html_25bc9a0a5f90e3aa.png)
  - Enter a project name and click continue
  - Disable the Google Analytics option for the project and click &quot;Create Project&quot;. Once the project is created, click continue.
  - Once on the project homepage, click the angle brackets web icon as highlighted below
 ![](RackMultipart20201122-4-136nf96_html_f06638472a5a77ef.png)
  - Give the web app a nickname. If you wish to host the website using firebase hosting, check the &quot;Also set up Firebase Hosting&quot; option. Click &quot;Register App&quot; after making your choice.

  - C ![](RackMultipart20201122-4-136nf96_html_eec4dcb97867ca60.png) licking &quot;Register App&quot; will show some scripts needed to link the application with firebase. The entire script is not needed, however. Copy the portion shown in the image below.
  - Once copied, open the previously downloaded project files (from Github) and navigate to the _Firebase_ folder located inside the _src_ folder.
  - You should see a Javascript (.js) file called config.js. Open it in a text editor, and you will see something similar to the image shown below.

  - Once this is complete, go back to the firebase console website where you copied the script from and click &quot;Continue to console&quot;.

**RUNNING APPLICATION**

- Launch a new terminal in the directory containing &quot;package.json&quot;. This is the same directory from which &quot;yarn install&quot; was done earlier. To run the app, type in &quot;yarn start&quot; and press enter. After a minute or so, a window in a browser should open with the application.

**TROUBLESHOOTING**

- If you encounter any problems with &quot;yarn install&quot;, make sure you have yarn installed on your machine using npm.
- With any other problem, try repeating the entire process again.

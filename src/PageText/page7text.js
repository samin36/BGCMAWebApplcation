    Your child’s opinions are important, and we want them to have the best
    experience at the Club! Our Clubs can only get better if we hear from our
    members. We invite your child to participate in BGCMA’s outcome assessments
    that focus on academic success, healthy lifestyles, character & leadership,
    and their opinions about this Club. To provide the children of this
    community with the most effective and fun programs requires us to
    periodically ask members about their life and their experiences in the club.
    The information we gather will be used to help Club staff better understand
    Club members and the programs that will best promote their overall success
    as students and as successful adults.

    By initialing below, you indicate that you are the parent or guardian of the
    person named in this membership application and that you give your consent
    to and give authorization for your child to participate in Member
    Assessments used by the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Atlanta, Department of

    The assessments will be administered 2-3 times over the school year in
    supervised groups at the Club. These assessments with Club members include,
    but are not limited to: confidential surveys on the outcome areas, reading
    and math assessments, and physical fitness assessments. We also collect
    demographic information and school report cards through the membership
    process. We hope you will allow your child to participate. As you consider
    doing so, we want you to know several things about BGCMA’s assessments and
    about your rights as a parent or guardian:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Your son/daughter’s participation in the assessments is entirely
      voluntary. You must give your permission for her or him to participate.
      You son or daughter must also agree to participate. If you do not give
      your permission, or if he/she decides not to participate, there will be no
      penalty or consequences for anyone involved.
    </li>
    <li>
      The purpose of the assessments is to satisfy reporting requirements to our
      community partners, to better understand positive youth development, and
      to create better programs—the information is not used for any other
      purpose. There are no right or wrong answers in the outcome surveys
      (questions are about feelings, opinions, and experiences).
    </li>
    <li>
      There are no known discomforts or hazards associated with
      participation—only assessments & surveys are involved.
    </li>
    <li>
      Copies of the assessments are available if you would like to review any of
      the questions being asked. To do so you must inform the Executive Director
      of your Club.

    All information from the assessments is kept confidential to the full extent
    allowed by law. The completed electronic surveys will remain secured within
    our membership database accessible only to BGCMA’s Evaluation & Measurement
    Team. No other children or adult staff at this Club or anywhere else will
    know what answers your child provides. All the findings will be combined,
    summarized and reported in group form so that it will be impossible to
    identify individual people. A summary of the findings will be made available
    to parents by request.

        RE: Use of Name, Photograph, Video and Identity in Connection with Advertising and/or Promotion of the Organization

        The Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Atlanta (BGCMA) will maintain all member files and records in a confidential and secure manner. In
        order to better serve members, BGCMA may file a formal data request with your child’s school district. If approved, BGCMA will
        share with the school district the names of members who attend the Clubs in that school district. This data request would grant
        BGCMA access to members’ existing academic data (e.g. grades, school attendance, or standardized testing results). BGCMA would
        use this data for three purposes: (a) identify members’ academic needs; (b) evaluate the effectiveness of BGCMA programming; (c)
        tailor programming and services to better meet members’ academic needs. Please indicate whether you authorize BGCMA to
        include your child in this school data release.
        Note: Files for all programs funded in whole or in part by the Georgia Department of Human Services are available for monitoring
        and subject to audit by the Georgia Department of Human Services. Communication of member information to persons or agencies
        other than listed above will require written approval of the member’s parent.

        Club during any outings during the After School/Summer Program.
        This form only gives permission for youth to travel with the Boys & Girls Clubs of Metro Atlanta. A parent’s signature must be on a
        sign-up sheet for each field trip before the youth will be allowed to attend that field trip or outing. A youth may only attend field
        trips open to their age group. Some field trips may have limited capacity; these sign-ups will be on a first come, first served basis.
